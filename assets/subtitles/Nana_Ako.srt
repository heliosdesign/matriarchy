1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:06,620
My grandmother was the queen mother

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:10,420
 when when she died my elder sister took over,

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,440
and then when she died I was made the Queen Mother

4
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:26,400
In the Asante Kingdom, when someone rapes a 
child or a family member, 

5
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,760
he is banished from the village,

6
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:32,260
This is because the person has brought a curse on 
the village,

7
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,180
so the person is driven out.

8
00:00:34,228 --> 00:00:41,428
Then the village performs certain rituals to take the 
curse out of the land.

9
00:00:43,005 --> 00:00:51,794
Anything on this land, be it palm tree, or sand -

10
00:00:52,628 --> 00:00:58,365
because in this town we have sand for construction 
and building purposes -

11
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:05,575
therefore when we sell these resources from the land, 
whatever the people need, we provide it 

12
00:01:05,925 --> 00:01:07,750
from the proceeds.

13
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:19,225
Some was used to build toilet facilities, electricity, 
wells for water

14
00:01:19,825 --> 00:01:29,250
and also with the introduction of formal education we 
built primary schools for our people.
