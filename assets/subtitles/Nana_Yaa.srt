1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:05,100
My name is Nana Yaa Adomaa.

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:11,880
My stool name is Adomakoa Atookuafuo, the king's 
wife Adomakoa Atookuafuo

3
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,833
I}n this town, the stool belongs to the wife of the Asante King.

4
00:00:19,366 --> 00:00:24,133
The Asante King gave this land to his wife who lived 
with the Atookwa people.

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:33,100
Because there is no male leader in this town, I the 
King's wife am in charge of this town.

6
00:00:34,566 --> 00:00:38,400
When there is a conflict between two parties, the 
matter is presented before me.

7
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:44,700
I sit in council with my Elders and brainstorm 
about it in order to bring peace.

8
00:00:45,733 --> 00:00:51,630
We hear both parties and based on our findings the 
one who is at fault is made to apologize

9
00:00:51,766 --> 00:00:55,300
and the one who has been offended is asked to be 
patient with the other

10
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,133
so that we can all live peacefully

11
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,233
When someone needs anything, they come to me

12
00:01:00,233 --> 00:01:02,833
and when I am in need of anything, I also ask

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,400
I live peacefully with everyone.

14
00:01:05,033 --> 00:01:10,466
My town folks see me as the King's wife with a 
high-level of knowledge.

15
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:14,966
When there is a situation that calls for my advice or 
a problem I need to solve, my Elders present

16
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,266
the matter to me and I preside over it.

17
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,666
That is how we rule in this town.

18
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,660
Everyone is welcome at any time to visit me.
